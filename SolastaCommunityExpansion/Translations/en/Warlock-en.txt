Subclass/&ClassWarlockPatronDescription=A Warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes the relationship between Warlock and patron is like that of a Cleric and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons are not gods.

Subclass/&DHWarlockSubclassElementalPatronDescription=You've been made a pact with and been changed by primordials present in the elemental badlands. The elemental chaos of the patron has suffused your soul, letting you use the power of different elemental types.

Subclass/&DHWarlockSubclassRiftWalkerDescription=Your patron is one of the rare beings who calls the void between worlds their home. They slip between the planes with ease and the knowledge you have gained from interacting with them allows you to harness lingering rift energies to your benefit within solasta. You might be sometimes filled with a longing for the distant realm of your patron, a desire to wander between dimensions for the rest of your days, or watch for signs of another Rift event, either to prevent or encourage.

Subclass/&WarlockAncientForestDescription=You have forged a relationship with a powerful nature entity: Ancient Dryads, Archdruids, Manifestations of the Feywild bleeding into the material plane, Forgotten gods from a primal age. Your patron may wish for you to protect the natural world, travel to far off lands that it cannot, or it may have another motive that seems inscrutable to short-lived mortals.

Subclass/&WarlockMoonLitDescription=Your patron is a spirit of the moon, an entity that embodies the cyclical nature of light and darkness. These spirits seek to maintain the power of the moon over the night sky while keeping profane powers that stalk the darkness at bay and task their warlocks with the same, granting them command over the powers of the moon and its effects.
